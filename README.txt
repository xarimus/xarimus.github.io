Known Issues:
On mobile, the mousover/hover effect is persistent after clicking one of the nav-pill buttons.

Fixed:
Actual mobile view not displaying correctly, appears to be based on "actual" pixels rather than device-width (zoomed out look)
--added <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> to <head> to force mobile viewport
